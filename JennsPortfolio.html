                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Born and raised in Los Angeles California. I worked in healthcare behind the scenes in the administration side before I started looking at coding. After some thorough research and many thoughts, I finally decided to join the UCLA Bootcamp to learn and become a Full Stack Web Developer. Many concepts were learned and I finally found joy in finding solutions to the problems that arose along with the joy of creating something out of nothing. </p>
