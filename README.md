# Mission

My mission on this assignment was to create my portfolio from scratch with methods I learned from class. I will continue to work on my portfolio and update it with newer skills and knowledge that I continue to learn. Ultimately, it will be the portfolio to which I present to future employers.

# Process

After my initial panic of having to start an html completely from scratch, I then drew a simple and quick draft on good-ole' pen and paper of what it would look like.

I started with inputting the beginning skeleton with all the meta data and links to start styling my portfolio.

Going in sequential order, I added the simple Navigation Bar and added the class so that it would snap to the area of the webpage it was referring to after clicking on it.

Then I added a simple "About Me" section which I hope to add more to after gaining more experience and confidence throughout this course.

Moving on to the "Work" section, I added placeholding images of a bear simply enjoying his catch after his hunt. I too hope to feel that satisfaction after every project!

Toward the end of the webpage, I added a form to allow anyone to "Contact Me" simply by entering their information.

I concluded by adding the finishing touches and final comment tags so that anyone else who read my code would be able to work it easily.

# Finished!

In the beginning, I started with a rough draft of what I wanted it to be. In that process, I had researched and found styles that I added but wasn't familiar with or taught yet. It confused me and didn't deliver the webpage afterall. With help from my wonderful tutor, he aided me in removing things that just weren't necessary at this stage in my journey and guided me patiently in simplifying the webpage back to its core. Always be grounded in the basics.
