# Mission

My mission on this assignment was to create my portfolio from scratch with methods I learned from class. I will continue to work on my portfolio and update it with newer skills and knowledge that I continue to learn. Ultimately, it will be the portfolio to which I present to future employers.

# Process

After my initial panic of having to start an html completely from scratch, I started with inputting the beginning skeleton with all the meta data and links to start styling my portfolio.

I then drew a quick draft on good-ole' pen and paper of what it would look like. I started with making my

I started by changing the semantics and spacing so that it was easier for me to read my code before I worked on it. This helped me stay organized a lot better and helped me pick up right after I left off whenever I needed to.

Then I continued with correcting the class and id's as certain figures and text needed to be linked properly.

Then I worked on accessibility and added all the alt to the figures which is needed for anyone to have access to the page.

Somewhere down the line, some code was misplaced, or bugged, so I had to go back and correct lines. This entailed me constantly changing and rechanging code and checking the html if it was working well.

I concluded by adding the finishing touches and final comment tags so that anyone else who read my code would be able to work it easily.

# Finished!

All in all, this was frustrating but honestly so fullfilling. The instant joy when a code is worked out or a page is debugged and when your final product is what it should be is so surprising. It's an overwhelming feeling of relief and satisfaction! I give thanks to all the direction, resources supplied and teamwork involved ❤️️
