# Mission

My mission on this assignment was to refactor existing code to meet the standards assigned to me. The aim of this homework was for me to not only recognize the terminology further, but also to utlize it efficiently. It was difficult, but a very good learning experience in the world of coders. "Fix one, interrupt the rest". With my recently learned knowledge, I created and executed a working page with all that was necessary to complete my task.

# Process

I started by changing the semantics and spacing so that it was easier for me to read my code before I worked on it. This helped me stay organized a lot better and helped me pick up right after I left off whenever I needed to.

Then I continued with correcting the class and id's as certain figures and text needed to be linked properly.

Then I worked on accessibility and added all the alt to the figures which is needed for anyone to have access to the page.

Somewhere down the line, some code was misplaced, or bugged, so I had to go back and correct lines. This entailed me constantly changing and rechanging code and checking the html if it was working well.

I concluded by adding the finishing touches and final comment tags so that anyone else who read my code would be able to work it easily.

# Finished!

All in all, this was frustrating but honestly so fullfilling. The instant joy when a code is worked out or a page is debugged and when your final product is what it should be is so surprising. It's an overwhelming feeling of relief and satisfaction! I give thanks to all the direction, resources supplied and teamwork involved ❤️️
